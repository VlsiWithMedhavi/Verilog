APB(Advanced peripheral bus) protocol
=====================================

Part of AMBA(Advanced microcontroller bus architecture) protocol family
AMBA divided into many types
 	1. APB (Advanced peripheral bus)
	2. AHB (Advanced high performance bus)
	3. ASB (Advanced system bus)
	4. AXI (Advanced auxiliary bus)
The microcontroller is connected to AHB/ASB which further connects to low bandwidth APB via APB Bridge. 
 - APB bridge(master)
 - Devices connected to APB(slave)


What is APB?
Protocol is used for accessing control registers of peripheral devices(slave
devices).
	- Simple Synchronous peripheral protocol.
	- Each transfer takes atleast 2 clock cycles (SETUP and ACCESS) to complete.
	- Not pipelined
	- Connects low BW peripheral : USB, keyboard, timer, etc


Why APB?
	- low cost
	- minimal power consumptions
	- reduced interface complexity

Disadvantages of APB
	- limited bandwidth
	- used with low speed peripheral devices only
	- reduced efficiency
Can be used with: USB, UART, keyboard, clock, i/o modules which require less
bandwidth
